    t02: "New Zealand social innovators take collaborative democracy tool global."
    t03: "New Zealand-based tech cooperative Loomio is today launching an international crowdfunding campaign to make their collaborative decision-making software accessible globally."

    t04: "\"The world needs a better way to make decisions together. So we're asking the world to help us build a new tool for truly inclusive decision-making - Loomio 1.0,\" said co-founder Alanna Krause."

    t05: "\"Real democracy is about collaboration, and it needs to include everyone. Loomio 1.0 will be mobile so people in developing nations without computers can access it, accessible so people of all abilities can use it, and easy for people to host themselves, so they can take complete control of their data and privacy.\""

    t06: "Loomio is a simple online tool for collaborative decision-making, built by a small team of open-source developers, facilitators and activists at the Enspiral social impact hub in Wellington, New Zealand. Loomio is driven by a social mission: To make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect them."

    t07: "Over the last 18 months, the Loomio team has built a prototype that's now being used by thousands of people around the world in groups as diverse as schools, businesses, social change movements, community organisations, and NGOs"

    t08: "Recently, the Greek Direct Democracy Alliance set up 461 Loomio groups, one for every prefecture and region of Greece, with plans to open a nationwide conversation about how to fix democracy in the lead-up to regional elections"

    t09: "\"We're delighted by the great things people are already doing with the prototype. We know its potential to empower great collaboration. But we also know its limitations. So now we need to step up and build a truly inclusive platform that's totally mobile and accessible to everyone\", said Krause"

    t10: "Loomio is using an open-source platform called CrowdtiltOpen to run their campaign, which allows fundraisers to build their own page and set stretch goals.  Loomio has a two-tier goal, with the first set at US$100,000 and the second at US$252,108"

    t11: "\"With US$100,000 we can build a great mobile, accessible tool. But we are aiming high with this campaign - if we hit our stretch goal, the Callaghan Innovation Fund in New Zealand has committed to matching 40% of the target amount. This will allow us to realise the full social change potential of Loomio by funding an SMS-based framework for parts of the world without internet access, and a collaboration training program in schools\", said Krause"

    t12: "\"Loomio is a values-driven social enterprise, and it's important to us that money should never be a barrier to meaningful participation in decision-making. We're embracing the gift economy, so that we can give something amazing back to the world.\""

    t13: "Loomio has already been translated into more than a dozen languages by volunteers around the globe. Within the past two weeks, Loomio users have started translating the software into Ukrainian, in response to requests from civic activists there."

    t14: "\"We're feeling more urgency than ever to get Loomio out into the world. We're crowdfunding so we can make it available where it's needed most.\""
